# All about me!

## So I love all things creative and artistic.

### I was very arty in school, drawing, painting, making things out of paper mache, clay, matches etc.....still do lol.
. With a dream of becoming a computer graphics designer.

#### I then went on to college on an art course learning more about complimentry colours creation of colours fine detail and so on.

##### Then life changed for me I needed to find money to pay rent and bills so took a paid city and guilds decorating course so still arty and stuck at that for 22 years.
#### I also started Taekwondo around that time so more martial arty learning head down dedicatuion and sticktoitedness achieving a black belt, regional and international championship trophies.
#### Moving on to Wingchun Kung-fu more sticktoitedness, sampled some Boxing and kick-Boxing then found Cage Fighting, achieving 8-0 until finally Jiu-jitsu and achieving 3  gold medals and a bronze. Im a bit old for all that now so back to creaty stuff  

##### I've been teaching myself programming with online tutorials on web design and making fun games. So I took the next step and started a course in web design to achieve a diploma in fullstack web development...
