# All about me!

## So I love all things creative and artistic.

### I was very arty in school, drawing, painting, making this etc. With a dream of becoming a computer graphics designer.

#### I then went on to college on an art course learning more about complimentry colours creation of colours fine detail and so on.

##### Then life changed for me I needed to find money to pay rent and bills so took a paid city and guilds decorating course so still arty and stuck at that for 22 years.

##### I've been teaching myself programming with online tutorials on web design and making fun games. So I took the next step and started a course in web design to achieve a diploma in fullstack web design.
